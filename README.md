# Prim-s-Algorithm

<p align="justify">
Prim’s algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. The prim’s algorithm starts from any node and then adds any adjacent node whose weight is the minimum, and this process continues till all the nodes in the graphs are visited. When creating the minimum spanning tree of a graph, we also have to do not create any cycles because cycles should not be in the minimum spanning tree.
